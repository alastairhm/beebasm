# Discovering BBC Micro Machine Code

Examples from the book [Discovering BBC Micro Machine Code by A.P. Stephenson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2911575-discovering-bbc-micro-machine)

The examples have been translated to use [BeebAsm assembler](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm/) rather than build in BASIC one.
